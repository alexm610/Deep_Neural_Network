# Deep Neural Network
A DNN for image classification; this project is a digital machine designed to classify an image of a hand-written digit and print the result onto 
a 7-segment HEX display. The project will be deployed on an FPGA, specifically a DE1-Soc, and will be primarily coded in SystemVerilog. The base of this project is from a digital design course at the University of British Columbia, CPEN 311, from the Fall semester of 2022.
